My first html/css/js code piece. The assignment was to recover a given picture.
Date: 2016-5-24


Part(A):
HTML&CSS: used [box-shadow] and [text-shadow] to approach the given picture.


Creativity in Part(B):

JAVASCRIPT:

[onmouseover] buttons change their backgroundColor, [onmouseout] change the color back.

After input, click [CALCULATE] button to calculate.

Used functions [checknum(),checkden()]to Check the validation of input during calculation.
(check numerator and denominator separately since denominator != 0).
If not validate, output the information under the Percentage column.

Used [alert] if some values cannot be used during calculating Mean and Average.

Click [RESET] button to reset all inputs and outputs.

[ANALYZATION] part. After calculation, if percentage is lower than 50%,
[onmouseover] function can be triggered on smiley faces and changed to sad faces.
(Note: the [Reset] function also reset all faces to smiley faces).
